### Modelling moonlight intensity on the ground ################
################################################################

# Model provides an iluminance value for a given location and time. Outcome of
# the model is a scalar quantity and represents a proportion of reference
# illumination value. The reference value, in this case, is luminance of full
# moon at 384400 km (average distance) in zenith. Model includes 4 variables,
# each providing a correction factor of 0-1: 1) visual extinction 2) distance to
# the moon relative to mean distance 3) phase effect 4) Angle of incidence of
# moonlight Final value is obtained by multiplying all 4 values.

############################## 1) Visual extinction of the stars depending on
###the angle of the atmosphere equations provided in: Green, Daniel W. E. 1992.
###"Magnitude Corrections for Atmospheric Extinction." International Comet
###Quarterly 14: 55-59 Average extinction coefficients (magnitude per air mass)
###are as follows:
#At sea level: 0.28
#At 500m asl: 0.24
#at 1000m asl: 0.21
#at 2000m asl: 0.16
#Default value in the model is for 1000m asl and, if needed,
###should be changed below: ############################

#Calculating thikness of the atmosphere (airmass value) at given elevation. Note
#that elevation is above the horizon, so we need to use 90-elevation from
#suncalc model. Might show false results for moon altitude <0, but these always
#have value 0 in end model so it doesn't matter. moon altitude must be in
#radians!

night$airMass <- 1/(cos(pi/2-night$moonAlt)+0.025*2.71827^(-11*cos(pi/2-night$moonAlt)))


#difference in magnitudes - in zenith the absortion reduces brightess by 0.24
#magnitude, or ~20%, a minimal value possible. We will calculate the difference
#between extinction at given angle and extinction at zenith and transform it to
#proportion

night$airMassMagnitude <- (night$airMass-1)*extCoef

night$atmExtinction <- 10^(-0.4*night$airMassMagnitude)
