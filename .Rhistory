### Modelling moonlight intensity on the ground ################
################################################################
# Model provides an iluminance value for a given location and time. Outcome of the model is a scalar quantity and represents a proportion of reference illumination value. The reference value, in this case, is luminance of full moon at 384400 km (average distance) in zenith.
# Model includes 4 variables, each providing a correction factor of 0-1:
# 1) visual extinction
# 2) distance to the moon relative to mean distance
# 3) phase effect
# 4) Angle of incidence of moonlight
# Final value is obtained by multiplying all 4 values.
##############################
### 1) Visual extinction of the stars depending on the angle of the atmosphere
### equations provided in: Green, Daniel W. E. 1992. "Magnitude Corrections for Atmospheric Extinction." International Comet Quarterly 14: 55-59
### Average extinction coefficients (magnitude per air mass) are as follows:
### At sea level: 0.28
### At 500m asl: 0.24
### at 1000m asl: 0.21
### at 2000m asl: 0.16
### Default value in the model is for 1000m asl and, if needed, should be changed below:
###############################
#extCoef <- 0.21
#Calculating thikness of the atmosphere (airmass value) at given elevation. Note that elevation is above the horizon,
#so we need to use 90-elevation from suncalc model.
#might show false results for moon altitude <0, but these always have value 0 in end model so it doesn't matter.
#moon altitude must be in radians!
night$airMass <- 1/(cos(pi/2-night$moonAlt)+0.025*2.71827^(-11*cos(pi/2-night$moonAlt)))
#difference in magnitudes - in zenith the absortion reduces brightess by 0.24 magnitude, or ~20%, a minimal value possible.
#We will calculate the difference between extinction at given angle and extinction at zenith and transform it to proportion
night$airMassMagnitude <- (night$airMass-1)*extCoef
