Description: Tools for predicting moonlight intensity on the ground based on 
    the position of the moon, atmospheric conditions, and other factors. 
    This package provides functions to calculate moonlight intensity and 
    related statistics for ecological and behavioral research, offering more 
    accurate estimates than simple moon phase calculations.
